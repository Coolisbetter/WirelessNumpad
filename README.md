# What
Wireless Numpad is a simple client/server application which simulates numpad key presses on the server as they are entered on the client

# Why
I purpose-built this app because I wanted a remote keypad which could switch OBS scenes on a streaming machine. With this program, I can have a wireless keypad plugged into a client PC, and by pressing the numpad keys, I can switch OBS scenes on a server PC.
